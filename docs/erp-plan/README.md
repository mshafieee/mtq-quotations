# MTQ Platform — From Quotation Tool to ERP + CRM + Accounting
# منصة متقنون — من أداة عروض الأسعار إلى نظام متكامل لتخطيط الموارد وإدارة العملاء والمحاسبة

> **Status:** plan v1.0 · 25 Sep 2026 · all open decisions resolved with the recommended answers ([decision log](05-roadmap.md#11-decision-log--recommended-answers-adopted-2026-09-25)).

## Executive summary

Motqinon Tech's quotation tool (`index.html`) already encodes valuable know-how — bilingual quotes with an auto-calculated installation line, FREE lines, strike-through pricing, VAT, contracts with 50/40/10 payment schedules and amounts in Arabic words. But it is a single browser page on Google Sheets/Drive with **no real login, publicly exposed customer data, no customer database, no invoicing and no project tracking** ([audit](01-current-state.md)).

We benchmarked the leading apps in every field — Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho, Odoo, ERPNext, D-Tools, Portal.io, ServiceTitan, Procore, Dynamics 365, NetSuite, Qoyod, Wafeq, Jisr, ZenHR, ThingsBoard and ≈ 80 others ([benchmark](02-market-benchmark.md), [raw research](research/README.md)) — and turned ≈ 670 benchmarked features into prioritised module backlogs.

**The plan:** build **MTQ Core**, an Arabic-first TypeScript platform for everything that differentiates an integrator/IoT company (CRM, CPQ, contracts, projects, field service, installed base, service, customer portal, IoT, AI), and run the commodity back office — **ledger, ZATCA e-invoicing, purchasing, stock, payroll** — on **ERPNext with an open-source KSA-compliance app and Frappe HR**, all hosted in **Google Cloud Dammam**. Staff get one front door; accountants keep a proven ledger; ZATCA compliance arrives in weeks instead of a year ([architecture](03-target-architecture.md)).

**Delivery:** eight phases over ≈ 12 months (≈ 47–50 person-months), each ending in production use — login page and Quotations/Contracts v2 first, compliant invoicing by **December 2026**, project tracking and the technician app by **spring 2027**, full accounting mid-2027, then HR/payroll, customer portal, IoT-connected service and AI ([roadmap](05-roadmap.md)).

## Key decisions (adopted)

| # | Decision |
|---|----------|
| 1 | **Hybrid architecture**: custom TypeScript front office (Next.js, NestJS, PostgreSQL) + **ERPNext** back office (ledger, ZATCA, stock, purchasing, Frappe HR) behind an idempotent sync port |
| 2 | **Login**: Google sign-in for the company domain + passkeys; TOTP/passkey mandatory for privileged roles; invitation-only; NIST 800-63B-4 & OWASP ASVS 5.0 L2 baseline |
| 3 | **Hosting in Saudi Arabia** (Google Cloud Dammam); multi-tenant-ready schema (RLS) to keep a SaaS option open |
| 4 | **ZATCA**: compliant invoicing from ERPNext by Dec 2026 (Wave 25 deadline 1 Feb 2027); 386 prepayment invoices for advances, 388 final with deductions; certified bridge SaaS now if not already compliant |
| 5 | **WhatsApp-first** customer communication (Cloud API, BSUID-aware, cost ledger) with PDPL consent |
| 6 | **Nafath-backed e-signature** for contracts via a DGA-licensed provider; OTP acceptance for quotes |
| 7 | **In-app RTL dashboards** (not Power BI/Metabase) for the 77-report catalogue |
| 8 | **Technician PWA** with serial/MAC scanning — the installed base is built during installation |
| 9 | **ThingsBoard** for IoT (reuse, don't build): alarms become tickets and uptime-based AMC tiers |
| 10 | **AI drafts, humans approve**: BOQ → quote, summaries, read-only MCP server; AI never issues tax documents |

## Phases

| Phase | Outcome | Indicative dates |
|-------|---------|------------------|
| 0 | Secure the current tool, back up data, confirm ZATCA status | Sep – Oct 2026 |
| 1 | **Login page**, users/roles, customers, products, **Quotations v2**, **Contracts v2**, dashboards v1 | Oct – Dec 2026 |
| 1F | ERPNext back office + ZATCA go-live (parallel) | Oct – Dec 2026 |
| 2 | CRM: leads, pipeline, WhatsApp inbox, online acceptance, e-signature | Jan – Feb 2027 |
| 3 | Invoicing & collections automated from contract milestones | Jan – Feb 2027 |
| 4 | **Project tracking**, work orders, technician app, installed base, handover | Feb – Apr 2027 |
| 5 | Procurement, imports, stock & serials | Feb – Apr 2027 |
| 6 | Full accounting rollout (bank, assets, VAT return, project P&L) | Apr – May 2027 |
| 7 | HR & payroll, helpdesk & AMC, customer portal, IoT & AI | Apr – Sep 2027 |

## Do this now (first two weeks)
1. **Stop the public exposure of customer data** in the current tool (company-only Drive sharing + Google sign-in) — [Phase 0](01-current-state.md#5-phase-0--immediate-hardening-of-the-current-app-12-weeks).
2. **Make this repository private and purge `contract.txt`** from git history (it contains a real client's personal data).
3. **Confirm Motqinon's ZATCA wave** on the FATOORA portal; if invoices are not Phase-2 integrated today, start a certified invoicing SaaS immediately.
4. Export all quotes, contracts, the product sheet and images to a dated archive.
5. Contract an ERPNext implementer and run the KSA-app capability spike (386/388, EGS per branch, webhooks).

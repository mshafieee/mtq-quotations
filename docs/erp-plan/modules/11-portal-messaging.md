# Module 11 — Customer Portal, WhatsApp & Notifications (بوابة العملاء والمراسلات)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Phases** | WhatsApp/e-mail sending → Phase 1 · Shared inbox & online acceptance → Phase 2 · Payment links → Phase 3 · Full customer portal → Phase 7b |
| **Benchmarked** | WhatsApp Business Platform (Cloud API, Flows, Calling), Saudi CPaaS (Unifonic, Taqnyat, Msegat), Amazon SES / Postmark / Resend, HubSpot/Zoho/Odoo inboxes, respond.io, Kommo, Jobber Client Hub, simPRO portal, D-Tools customer portal, Odoo portal |
| **Business owner** | Customer Service lead |

## 1. Goals
1. Reach customers where they are — **WhatsApp first** — with approved, bilingual, cost-controlled messages linked to the right record.
2. Let customers self-serve: view/accept quotes, sign contracts, pay, follow project progress, see devices & warranty, open tickets.
3. Respect PDPL consent, Meta template rules and CST SMS rules automatically.

## 2. WhatsApp rules & costs that shape the design

| Date | Change | Design consequence |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| 1 Jul 2025 | Billing per delivered **template** message by category (marketing / utility / authentication) and country; utility templates inside an open 24-h window were free | Classify templates carefully; operations use **utility** only |
| 15 Jan 2026 | Meta bans **general-purpose AI chatbots** on the platform; business-specific bots allowed | Our WhatsApp assistant stays scoped to Motqinon's sales/support |
| 1 Apr 2026 | Saudi marketing rate raised (≈ SAR 0.19 marketing vs ≈ SAR 0.04 utility/authentication, third-party figures — verify on Meta's rate card) | Marketing ≈ 4–5× utility; campaigns budgeted |
| Apr–Jun 2026 | **BSUID** (business-scoped user ID) in webhooks; **usernames** — users can message without revealing a phone number | Contact identity = phone **or** BSUID |
| **1 Oct 2026** | **Service messages become billable** after 1,000 free per business phone number per month; utility templates inside the window charged again; 72-h free-entry window from Click-to-WhatsApp ads stays free | Message **cost ledger** per record; volume monitoring per number |

SMS (CST): licensed provider only; sender IDs pre-registered; promotional sender IDs end with **"-AD"**; promotional SMS only **08:00–22:00**; opt-out honoured within 24 h. Marketing on any personal channel needs **prior consent** (PDPL Art. 25).

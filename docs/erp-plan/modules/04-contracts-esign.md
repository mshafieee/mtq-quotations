## 1. Goals
1. Generate a legally sound bilingual contract from an accepted quote in minutes, with data pulled from the customer master and company settings (no hard-coded names, phones or IBANs).
2. Sign electronically with a method that stands up in Saudi courts (Nafath-verified via a licensed trust service provider for B2B).
3. Turn the signed contract into **billing milestones**, a **project**, and tracked **obligations** (delivery clock, warranty, spare parts, renewals).

| 2 | المواصفات الفنية والأسعار | Item table, fixed prices, changes only in writing | Items, totals |

| 7 | الضمان والصيانة | 2-year warranty from installation & operation; exclusions; 10-year spare parts | Months, years |
| 8 | نسخ العقد | Two originals (or electronic original when e-signed) | Signing method |
| New | لغة العقد | Arabic text prevails over English | — |
| New | حماية البيانات الشخصية | Face-recognition / resident data processing and consent (PDPL) — **legal review required** | Applies when biometric devices are quoted |

## 5. Business rules
1. A contract can only be created from the **latest accepted revision**; its lines, prices and totals are copied (snapshots) and the quote becomes read-only.
2. Milestone percentages must total 100% of the VAT-inclusive contract value; amounts are rounded so that the last milestone absorbs the rounding difference.
3. B2B contracts require customer unified number/CR, VAT number, national address and signatory before *Approved*.
4. Signed contracts are immutable; every later change is a **change order** that references the contract, updates the running value and (if approved) extends the delivery window by its `days impact`.
5. The **delivery clock** starts at the later of: advance payment received (module 08) and client approvals signed (module 05); working days exclude Fri–Sat and public holidays (company calendar).
6. The advance (50%) is invoiced as an **advance-payment tax invoice** on receipt, and later milestone invoices deduct it per ZATCA rules (module 08).

## 6. Screens
Contract list & repository · Contract editor (parties, clause picker, milestones builder, preview) · Signature tracker (who signed, when, method) · Obligations calendar · Change-order editor with highlighted differences · Contract detail (timeline, documents, milestones, invoices, project link).

## 7. Acceptance criteria (Phase 1 exit)
- A contract generated from a migrated quote reproduces today's layout and amounts (including tafqit) exactly.
- Company data (names, representative, phones, IBAN, stamp) comes only from settings.
- Milestones stored as data (not text) and visible on the contract page.
- Signed/issued contract PDFs are archived with hash and cannot be edited.

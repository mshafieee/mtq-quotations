# Module 01 — Platform: Login, Users, Roles, Security & Settings (المنصة: الدخول والمستخدمون والصلاحيات والإعدادات)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Phases** | P0 → Phase 1 · P1 → Phases 2–4 · P2 → Phase 7 / SaaS stage |
| **Benchmarked** | Auth0 (Okta CIC), Microsoft Entra External ID, Google Workspace, Clerk, Supabase Auth, Keycloak 26.7, WorkOS, Better Auth; authorisation models of Salesforce, Dynamics 365/Dataverse, Odoo 19, ERPNext/Frappe, Zoho CRM; standards NIST SP 800-63B-4 (final 2025), OWASP ASVS 5.0 (May 2025), OWASP Top 10:2025 |
| **Business owner** | Owner/Admin |

## 1. Goals
1. Replace the self-typed user ID with **real identity**: company Google accounts, passkeys and MFA — same sign-in for MTQ Core and the ERPNext back office.
2. Give every user exactly the access their job needs (role × record scope × field groups × approval limits), enforced on the server and backed by database Row-Level Security.
3. Make every change traceable (append-only audit log, record history, login events).
4. Move every hard-coded constant (company names, representatives, phones, IBANs, VAT rate, payment split) into **settings**.

**Rules on the page**
- Arabic by default, English toggle remembered per device; RTL layout; OTP fields accept Arabic-Indic digits (٠–٩) and normalise them.
- Generic error messages ("بيانات الدخول غير صحيحة") — never reveal whether an e-mail exists.
- Throttling with growing delays and a CAPTCHA/Turnstile challenge on risk signals; authenticator disabled after ≤ 100 consecutive failures (NIST 63B-4).
- No public sign-up: staff accounts come only from invitations.
- "Remember this device" (skip MFA up to 30 days) is **not available** to admins, finance, HR or approvers.

## 5. Security baseline (from the audit of today's tool)
Phase 0 closes the critical findings (public Drive folders, unauthenticated save endpoint, typed admin ID, stored XSS); the new platform never exposes storage directly to browsers, escapes all output by default, keeps secrets in Secret Manager/KMS, and runs OWASP ASVS 5.0 L2 checks — see [03-target-architecture.md §12](../03-target-architecture.md#12-security-architecture).

## 6. Acceptance criteria (Phase 1 exit)
- Every user signs in with Google or a passkey; privileged roles cannot complete sign-in without a passkey/TOTP.
- A sales rep cannot read another rep's quote or any cost/margin field through the UI **or** the API (automated tests).
- Every create/update/approve/issue action appears in the audit log with before/after values.
- Company data on generated documents comes only from settings; changing the IBAN requires step-up authentication and is audited.
- Sessions can be listed and revoked; deactivating a user ends their sessions immediately.

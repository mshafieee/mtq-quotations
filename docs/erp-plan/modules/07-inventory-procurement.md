# Module 07 — Inventory, Procurement & Imports (المخزون والمشتريات والاستيراد)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Phases** | Item master sync → Phase 1 · P0 → Phase 5 · P1 → Phase 5 (late) / Phase 7 · P2 → later |
| **Benchmarked** | Odoo 19 (Inventory, Purchase, Barcode, Quality, Repairs), ERPNext v15/16 (Stock, Buying), Oracle NetSuite 2026.1, Dynamics 365 Business Central, SAP Business One 10, Zoho Inventory, Cin7 Core, Fishbowl/Katana |
| **System of record** | **ERPNext** (stock ledger, valuation, purchasing, serials) — MTQ Core owns BOQ-driven demand, technician consumption and the installed base |
| **Business owner** | Operations Manager with Storekeeper/Purchaser |

**Where each capability is implemented:** **E** = ERPNext standard (configuration) · **X** = `mtq_ksa` Frappe extension (custom fields/doctypes) · **C** = MTQ Core (TypeScript) · **C↔E** = Core UI/automation over ERPNext data.

## 1. Goals
1. Every device is traceable from supplier PO → receipt (serial + MAC) → warehouse/van → project → installed unit → warranty/RMA.
2. Signed contracts reserve stock and generate purchase demand automatically, protecting the 45–60 working-day delivery commitment.
3. True landed cost (freight, duty, clearance) flows into margins; import compliance (SABER, CST, FASAH) is tracked per model and shipment.
4. Technicians consume stock from vans/project sites through the PWA without accounting knowledge.

## 2. Procure-to-install flow

# Module 09 — HR, Payroll, Attendance & Commissions (الموارد البشرية والرواتب والعمولات)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Phases** | P0 → Phase 7a (site attendance & timesheets start in Phase 4) · P1 → Phase 7a (late) · P2 → later |
| **Benchmarked** | Jisr (جسر), ZenHR, Bayzat, PalmHR, Menaitech, Zoho People + Zoho Payroll (KSA), Odoo 19 (`l10n_sa_hr_payroll`), Rippling, BambooHR, Personio; commissions: Salesforce Spiff, CaptivateIQ, Xactly, Zoho CRM Commission Management |
| **System of record** | **Frappe HR** on the ERPNext back office + `mtq_ksa` extension (GOSI rates, Mudad file, Qiwa/Nitaqat, document expiry) — MTQ Core owns commissions, technician site attendance and incentives |
| **Business owner** | HR Officer with Finance Manager |

> **Why not a Saudi HR SaaS first?** Jisr and ZenHR set the local bar (GOSI, Mudad, Muqeem, Qiwa automation). At Motqinon's size (≈ 10–40 staff) the rules are small and stable, the Mudad step is a file upload, and the real value is in the links — technician hours → project cost, collections → commissions — which HR SaaS products don't provide. Payroll therefore runs on Frappe HR (native posting to the ERPNext ledger) with a thin KSA extension. **Fallback (D7):** Jisr, ZenHR or PalmHR if payroll must go live before the back office, or when headcount passes ≈ 60–75, multiple CRs appear, or the Mudad compliance percentage drops.

## 1. Goals
1. Never miss an iqama, passport, insurance or licence expiry; keep contracts documented in Qiwa.
2. Pay correctly and on time: salary components, GOSI/SANED at the **rates in force on the pay date**, deductions, loans, Mudad (WPS) file, payslips.
3. Know where technicians' hours go (project sites) and pay sales commissions only on money collected.
4. Stay inside Saudization rules — especially **60% Saudi sales staff** (since 19 Apr 2026, establishments with ≥ 3 sales staff).

## 2. Saudi rules to encode (verify yearly and on every ministerial decision)

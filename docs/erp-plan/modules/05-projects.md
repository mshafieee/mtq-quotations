# Module 05 — Projects & Execution Tracking (إدارة المشاريع ومتابعة التنفيذ)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Phases** | P0 → Phase 4 · P1 → Phase 4 (late) / Phase 7 · P2 → later |
| **Benchmarked** | Procore, monday.com, Asana, ClickUp, Microsoft Planner Premium / Project, Smartsheet, Odoo Project + Timesheets, Zoho Projects, D-Tools Cloud, simPRO, Jetbuilt |
| **Business owner** | Projects Manager |

## 1. Goals
1. Every signed contract becomes a tracked project with a clear stage, owner, next step and date.
2. Encode Motqinon's contract logic: **stage gates** (advance paid, client approvals signed, 40% before delivery, 10% after programming) and the **45–60 working-day delivery clock**.
3. Give evidence and control: approvals, surveys, photos, test sheets, snag list, handover and warranty start — all on one record.
4. Show money per project: billing milestones, costs, margin, change orders.

## 2. Project flow & stage gates

```

**Delivery clock:** starts at the *later* of (a) advance received and (b) written client approval of specs, door directions, room numbers and design; counts **working days** on the company calendar (Sun–Thu, public holidays and Eid excluded); target window 45–60 days; warnings at 70% and 90% of the window; approved change orders and documented client/consultant delays extend it; every pause is logged as evidence.

## 4. Saudi operating rules built into scheduling
- Working week **Sun–Thu**; Fri–Sat weekend; public holidays (Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha, Founding Day 22 Feb, National Day 23 Sep).
- **Ramadan** profile: Muslim workers limited to 6 h/day (36 h/week); evening visits common.
- **Midday outdoor-work ban** 12:00–15:00 from 15 Jun to 15 Sep: block *outdoor* tasks (outdoor-unit mounting, external cabling) in that window; indoor programming allowed.
- Optional soft blocks around prayer times (Makkah/Jeddah, Umm al-Qura method) in technician calendars and ETAs.
- Makkah seasonality (Hajj, last ten nights of Ramadan): capacity and access warnings on affected projects.
- Gregorian dates for all computations; Hijri shown alongside on contracts, work orders and certificates.

## 5. Screens
Project list & portfolio · Project cockpit (stage/gates, delivery clock, milestones & payments, tasks, approvals, documents, budget, timeline) · Kanban/Gantt · Approval package editor & signature tracker · Site survey forms · Snag list · Commissioning sheets · Handover package builder · Project P&L.

## 6. Reports (see [module 10](10-reports-bi.md))
PR1 Project P&L · PR2 Budget vs actual (EAC) · PR3 Backlog · PR4 Billing milestones · PR5 Project health · PR6 Change orders · PR7 Retention · PR8 Labor hours plan vs actual · PR9 Estimate accuracy.

## 7. Acceptance criteria (Phase 4 exit)
- Every active contract has a project created from a template with gates enforced (no manual bypass without a logged override permission).
- Delivery-clock dates are computed on the company calendar and match a manual check for 10 sample projects.
- Handover generates a bilingual package with a complete device schedule, and warranty records start on the acceptance date.
- Milestone invoice drafts appear automatically when gates pass.

# Module 08 — Accounting, Invoicing & ZATCA (المحاسبة والفوترة الإلكترونية)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Phases** | Back-office setup & compliant invoicing → Phase 1F · Core billing integration → Phase 3 · Full accounting → Phase 6 |
| **Benchmarked** | QuickBooks Online Advanced, Xero, Zoho Books (Saudi edition), Odoo Accounting (`l10n_sa`, `l10n_sa_edi`), Oracle NetSuite, Sage Intacct; Saudi SaaS Qoyod, Wafeq (incl. e-invoicing API), Daftra; ERPNext with open-source ZATCA apps (LavaLoon *KSA Compliance*, ERPGulf *zatca_erpgulf*) |
| **System of record** | **ERPNext + KSA compliance app** (ledger, tax invoices, ZATCA, payments, AR/AP, bank, assets, VAT) — MTQ Core owns billing milestones, payment requests and customer-facing finance views |
| **Business owner** | Finance Manager with the external accountant |

## 1. Goals
1. **Compliant tax invoicing now** (ZATCA Phase 2) and for every future wave, without writing our own cryptographic signer.
2. Contract milestones (50/40/10) turn into payment requests, receipts and the correct **386/388** invoice sequence automatically.
3. A proper double-entry ledger with project dimensions so every contract shows its real margin.
4. Month-end close in ≤ 5 working days; VAT return prepared from the system.

## 2. ZATCA e-invoicing — what must be true (checklist)

**Status (25 Sep 2026):** Wave 23 (> SAR 750k) integrated 1 Jan–31 Mar 2026 · **Wave 24 (> SAR 375k) by 30 Jun 2026** · **Wave 25 (> SAR 187.5k, revenue years 2022–2025) by 1 Feb 2027** (announced 24 Jul 2026). ZATCA notifies each taxpayer ≥ 6 months ahead; Phase 1 has applied to all VAT registrants since 4 Dec 2021.

| Area | Requirement | Owner in our design |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| Format | UBL 2.1 XML (KSA profile) is the legal record; PDF/A-3 with embedded XML optional for sharing | KSA app |
| Documents | **388** tax invoice, **386** prepayment invoice, **381** credit note, **383** debit note; subtype 01 (standard/B2B) or 02 (simplified/B2C) + flags (third-party, nominal, export, summary, self-billed) | KSA app + Core requests the right type |
| Flows | Standard (B2B): **clearance before sharing** — share the cleared XML/PDF · Simplified (B2C): share immediately, **report within 24 h** | KSA app + Core waits for clearance before sending B2B PDFs |
| Identifiers & chain | UUID; **ICV** per EGS unit (sequential, never reset); **PIH** previous-invoice hash (first = base64 SHA-256 of "0"); hash of the canonicalised invoice | KSA app (per-EGS serialised queue) |
| Cryptographic stamp | XAdES-BES, ECDSA **secp256k1**, certificate = production CSID; keys protected | KSA app (keys encrypted; access restricted) |
| QR | TLV → Base64; tags 1–5 (seller, VAT no., timestamp, total, VAT), 6–8 (hash, signature, public key), 9 (ZATCA stamp signature, simplified) | KSA app |
| Seller data | Arabic legal name exactly as on the VAT record; VAT no. (15 digits, starts & ends with 3); CRN/unified number; national address (building no. 4 digits, postal code 5 digits, district, city, additional no.) | Company settings (module 01) → ERPNext |
| Buyer data (B2B) | Name, national address, VAT no. or other ID scheme (CRN, 700 unified no., NAT, IQA, PAS…) | Customer master (module 02) → ERPNext |
| Lines & totals | Qty, price, discount, net, VAT category (S/Z/E/O) & rate, VAT; **VATEX** exemption codes for Z/E/O; rounding half-up to 2 decimals with line/total reconciliation; tax currency SAR | Tax templates in ERPNext; Core previews use the same rules |
| Corrections | Never edit an issued invoice; 381/383 reference the original + reason; rejected documents still consume the chain (next PIH uses the rejected hash) | KSA app + process |
| Onboarding | Per EGS unit: OTP from FATOORA portal (expires in 1 h) → CSR (secp256k1; SN `1-solution\|2-version\|3-serial`, title `1100`) → compliance CSID → compliance samples (standard & simplified invoice, credit, debit) → production CSID → monitor expiry & renew | Implementer + accountant in Phase 1F |
| Environments | Developer portal (sandbox) → **simulation** (pre-production, not counted) → **core** (production; switch is irreversible) | Staging on simulation, production on core |
| Archive | Signed and cleared XML + PDF, offline-accessible, ≥ 6 years (10 as safe default); submission log append-only | ERPNext + Core archive mirror |
| Penalties | Warning first; escalating fines for repeats (e.g., missing QR SAR 1,000 → 5,000 → 10,000…; overall SAR 5,000–50,000 reported) | — |

**Contract billing mapping (confirm with the tax advisor):**

| Event | Document | VAT point | Journal effect |
|-------|----------|----------|----------------|
| Payment request for 50% (non-tax document) | — | none | none |
| 50% received | **386** prepayment invoice | at receipt | Dr Bank / Cr Customer advances / Cr Output VAT |
| 40% received before delivery | **386** | at receipt | same |
| Programming complete (final) | **388** for 100% with `PrepaidAmount` = advances (net + VAT) and references to each 386 | on the remaining 10% | Dr AR + Dr Advances / Cr Revenue / Cr Output VAT |
| Advance refunded | **381** against the 386 | reverses VAT | Dr Output VAT / Cr Advances |

## 4. Saudi specifics to configure
- **VAT:** 15%; registration mandatory above SAR 375k (voluntary above 187.5k); returns quarterly (monthly above SAR 40M) due by the end of the following month; penalties for late filing (5–25%), late payment (1% per 30 days) and incorrect returns.
- **Advances:** VAT is due on receipt to the extent paid; issuing an invoice before payment also triggers VAT — hence payment requests first, 386 on receipt.
- **Imports:** VAT on goods paid at customs is input tax; duty/freight go to inventory cost; imported services under reverse charge.
- **WHT:** 5% (rent, freight, telecoms, dividends, consulting/technical services, insurance…), 15% (royalties, head-office services, other), 20% (management fees); remit monthly; no WHT on goods.
- **Zakat:** 2.5% of the Zakat base for Saudi/GCC-owned entities; return within 120 days of year end.
- **Standards & records:** IFRS for SMEs as endorsed by SOCPA; keep tax records ≥ 6 years (longer for capital assets; 10 years as safe default); cheques payable on presentation.

## 5. Reports (see [module 10](10-reports-bi.md))
A1 AR aging · A2 Customer statement · A3 AP aging · A4 P&L · A5 Balance sheet · A6 Trial balance / GL · A7 VAT return · A8 E-invoice status · A9 Cash & bank position · A10 DSO & collection effectiveness · A11 Revenue by stream · A12 13-week cash forecast · A13 Budget vs actual · PR1 Project P&L · PR4 Billing milestones · PR7 Retention.

## 6. Acceptance criteria
- **Phase 1F:** EGS units for both branches onboarded in production; the accountant issues 386, 388 (with advance deduction) and 381 documents that are cleared/reported without errors; opening trial balance agreed with the accountant.
- **Phase 3:** a milestone reached in Core produces the payment request, and the receipt produces the correct ERPNext document automatically; B2B PDFs are sent only after clearance; ≥ 99% first-time clearance/reporting over one month; nightly reconciliation shows zero unexplained drift.
- **Phase 6:** month-end close ≤ 5 working days; VAT return from the system matches the filed return; project P&L available for every active contract.

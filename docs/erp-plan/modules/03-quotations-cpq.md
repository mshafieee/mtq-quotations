## 1. Goals
1. Keep today's speed: a rep builds a 20-line bilingual quote in ≤ 3 minutes.
2. Add control: statuses, revisions, approvals, margin visibility and an archive of exactly what was sent.
3. Add conversion: online acceptance, one click to contract, project, purchase orders and invoices.
4. Differentiate: integrator-grade CPQ (packages, alternatives, labor, capacity rules, BOQ import, AI drafting).

## 4. Business rules
1. **Totals** follow today's rules exactly ([01-current-state.md §2](../01-current-state.md#business-rules-embedded-in-the-code-carry-over-exactly)), plus line discounts; amounts computed with decimals and rounded to 2 places per line; the header discount is allocated to lines pro-rata for tax so quote totals equal the future invoice totals.
2. **Default approval matrix** (configurable): header discount > 10%, any line more than 15% below list, any non-labor FREE line, quote margin < 20% or total > SAR 250k → Sales Manager; margin < 10% or total > SAR 1M → General Manager.
3. **Locking:** once sent, a revision is read-only; edits create `R+1`; only the latest revision can be accepted.
4. **Validity:** default 10 days; expired quotes cannot be accepted until re-validated by a new revision.
5. **B2B data completeness:** CR/unified number, VAT number (15 digits, starts and ends with 3) and national address are warned at quote stage and **required** before contract/invoice.
6. **Cost privacy:** cost, margin and supplier fields are never rendered in customer documents and are filtered from API responses for roles without permission.
7. **Win-rate counting:** all revisions of one opportunity count once; quotes > 30 days past validity count as lost.

# Module 06 — Field Service, Installed Base, Warranty/AMC & Helpdesk (الخدمة الميدانية والأصول المركبة والصيانة والدعم)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Phases** | P0 → Phase 4 (work orders, technician PWA, installed base, service-call intake) · P1 → Phase 7b (AMC, SLAs, full helpdesk, portal) · P2 → later |
| **Benchmarked** | ServiceTitan, simPRO, Jobber, Housecall Pro, Salesforce Field Service (Agentforce), Dynamics 365 Field Service + Connected Field Service, Zoho FSM, Odoo Field Service, D-Tools Cloud; Zendesk, Freshdesk, Zoho Desk |
| **Business owner** | Operations / Service Manager |

## 1. Goals
1. One **installed-base registry**: every device Motqinon installs is known by site → building → floor → unit, serial, MAC, IP, firmware, install date and warranty end.
2. Technicians run their day from a **mobile PWA** (Arabic, offline-tolerant): jobs, navigation, checklists, photos, serial scanning, signature, service report sent by WhatsApp.
3. Every warranty call or fault becomes a **ticket → work order** with an automatic coverage decision (warranty / AMC / chargeable).
4. Grow **recurring revenue** with AMC contracts, preventive visits and (Phase 7c) IoT monitoring.

## 3. Work-order lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> New
  New --> Scheduled: booked on dispatch board
  Scheduled --> Dispatched: sent to technician
  Dispatched --> EnRoute: technician started travel
  EnRoute --> OnSite: GPS check-in
  OnSite --> AwaitingParts: parts missing
  AwaitingParts --> Scheduled: parts available
  OnSite --> Completed: checklist, photos, serials, signature
  Completed --> Closed: reviewed and billed if chargeable
  New --> Cancelled
  Scheduled --> Cancelled
  Closed --> [*]
  Cancelled --> [*]
```

## 4. Design rules
1. **One location tree and one asset tree**: work orders, tickets, agreements and IoT alarms all reference `site_location` and `installed_asset`.
2. Coverage (warranty / AMC / chargeable) is **computed** when a ticket or work order is created and stored with the reason.
3. The ThingsBoard asset tree mirrors the ERP location tree, so alarms roll up per customer/site (module 12).
4. Resident personal data (names, phones in the intercom directory) is personal data under PDPL; **face templates and images are never stored in the ERP**; every credential reveal is logged.

## 5. Screens
Dispatch board · Work-order detail · Technician PWA (My day, Job, Checklist, Scan, Signature, Report) · Installed-base explorer (site tree + device list + asset page) · Ticket inbox · Agreement (AMC) editor · Preventive-maintenance calendar · RMA list.

## 6. Reports (see [module 10](10-reports-bi.md))
F1 Jobs board summary · F2 Installed-base register · F3 Job completion compliance · F4 Devices per technician-day · F5 First-time-fix · F6 Repeat visits · F7 SLA compliance · F8 Technician utilisation · F9 Warranty/AMC expiry pipeline · F10 MTTR & response time.

## 7. Acceptance criteria
- **Phase 4:** 100% of devices installed in new projects registered with serial/MAC and unit; work orders completed only with mandatory evidence; service reports delivered by WhatsApp; warranty calls opened as tickets with automatic coverage decision.
- **Phase 7b:** AMC contracts generate preventive work orders and recurring invoices; SLA timers and escalations active; knowledge base published in Arabic.

# 04 — Data Model (نموذج البيانات)

> Logical model for the whole platform, organised by module. Diagrams show the **key relationships only**; the tables below each diagram list the important fields. Physical details (indexes, partitions) are decided per module during implementation.
>
> **Where each entity lives** (see [03-target-architecture.md §3](03-target-architecture.md#3-systems-of-record)): sections 2–5 are stored in **MTQ Core** (PostgreSQL). Sections 6–8 are the logical view of data whose **system of record is the ERPNext back office**; each of those sections ends with the ERPNext doctype mapping and the mirror/reference tables Core keeps.

## 1. Conventions (apply to every table)

| Convention | Rule | Why |
|-----------|------|-----|
| Primary keys | `id UUIDv7` (time-ordered) | Globally unique, merge-safe, index-friendly |
| Human numbers | Separate `number` column filled from a **numbering series** (e.g., `Q-2026-80012`, `MTQCT-073`, `INV-2026-00001`) | Legacy formats continue; numbers never reused |
| Tenancy | `tenant_id` on every row + PostgreSQL Row-Level Security | Keeps a SaaS option open without a rewrite |
| Company / branch | `company_id`, `branch_id` on transactional rows | Multi-company, branch reporting, ZATCA per branch/EGS |
| Audit columns | `created_at/by`, `updated_at/by`, `version` (optimistic lock) | Traceability, safe concurrent edits |
| Deletion | Master data: soft delete (`archived_at`). Issued documents: **never deleted** — cancelled, voided or reversed | Legal/tax record-keeping |
| Money | `NUMERIC(18,2)` for amounts, `NUMERIC(18,4)` for unit prices, `NUMERIC(18,6)` for rates; decimal library in code (no floats) | Exact VAT/ZATCA rounding |
| Currency | Every monetary document stores `currency`, `exchange_rate`, amounts in document currency **and** company currency (SAR) | Imports in USD/CNY, reporting in SAR |
| Dates | Timestamps in UTC (`timestamptz`); business dates as `date` in `Asia/Riyadh`; Hijri shown on demand (Umm al-Qura) | Correct day boundaries and bilingual display |
| Bilingual text | Master-data names as `name_ar` + `name_en` (or `jsonb {ar,en}` for long texts) | Arabic-first documents with English mirror |
| Snapshots | Document lines copy product code/description/price at issue time | Old documents never change when the catalog changes |
| Extensibility | `custom jsonb` column + `custom_field_def` table per entity | Admin-defined fields without migrations |
| Attachments & chatter | Polymorphic `attachment`, `note`, `activity` tables keyed by (`entity_type`, `entity_id`) | One timeline on every record |
| Events | `domain_event` outbox table written in the same transaction | Reliable notifications, integrations, webhooks |

## 3. Parties & CRM

A single **party** table holds every organisation or person the company deals with; *roles* (customer, supplier, partner) are profile tables. This avoids duplicates when a contractor is both a customer and a referral partner.

| `saudization_snapshot` | date, weighted Saudi count (≥ SAR 4,000 = 1, below = 0.5; Qiwa-documented contracts only), Nitaqat band, ratios per profession group (sales 60%, engineering 30%) |

**System of record: Frappe HR (on the ERPNext back office) + `mtq_ksa` extension.** Mapping: `employee` → *Employee* (+ KSA fields) · `employment_contract` → custom *Employment Contract* (Qiwa ID, authentication status) · `employee_document` → custom doctype with expiry alerts · `attendance_record` → *Employee Checkin* / *Attendance* · `leave_*` → *Leave Type* / *Leave Allocation* / *Leave Application* · `payroll_run`/`payslip` → *Payroll Entry* / *Salary Slip* · `salary_component` → *Salary Component* · `loan` → *Employee Advance* / Lending app · `eos_settlement` → *Gratuity* (+ *Full and Final Statement*) · `statutory_rate`, `saudization_snapshot`, Mudad salary file → `mtq_ksa` doctypes.
**Core keeps:** `commission_plan`/`commission_entry` (owner — it sees quotes, contracts and collections), `site_attendance_event` (technician GPS check-ins from work orders), `technician_incentive`; pushed to Frappe HR as *Additional Salary* and attendance before each payroll cut-off.

## 9. Integration tables (MTQ Core)

| Table | Key fields |
|-------|-----------|
| `erp_link` | entity_type, entity_id, erp_doctype, erp_name, last_synced_at, checksum, sync_status |
| `outbox_event` | id, aggregate, event_type, payload, created_at, delivered_at, attempts, last_error |
| `inbox_event` | source (ERPNext, WhatsApp, payment gateway, ThingsBoard, e-sign), external_id (idempotency key), payload, received_at, processed_at |
| `sync_reconciliation_run` | run_at, entity, core_count, erp_count, core_total, erp_total, status, drift details |
| `message_cost_entry` | message id, channel, category (marketing/utility/authentication/service), country, unit cost, related record — for the WhatsApp/SMS cost ledger |

## 10. Cross-module traceability ("document flow")

Every downstream record stores the upstream reference, so any screen can show the chain:

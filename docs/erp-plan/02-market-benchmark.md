# 02 — Market Benchmark: What the Leading ("Edge") Apps Implement (مقارنة بأفضل التطبيقات)

> Research date **25 Sep 2026**. Eight parallel research streams benchmarked **≈ 100 products** and recorded **≈ 670 features/options** with priorities. The full inventories (with sources and verification notes) are in [`research/`](research/README.md); the curated, prioritised backlogs live in the [module specs](README.md#documents).
>
> **Verification note:** direct fetches of many vendor and government sites were blocked in the research environment, so most facts come from search-indexed extracts of official pages, cross-checked against primary sources on GitHub where possible (NIST, OWASP, Odoo/ERPNext code, ZATCA SDK rules). Items that could not be confirmed are marked *(unverified)* in the research notes — re-check them before contractual or legal use.

| **Credentials vault** for device/admin passwords with audited reveal | Security gap in every FSM benchmarked |
| **Scan-to-commission** (serial/MAC → building/unit → warranty) | Installed base built as a by-product of installation |
| **Compliance-certificate gate** (SABER PCoC/SCoC, CST type approval) on POs and sales | Avoids blocked shipments and illegal sales of radio devices |
| **10-year spare-parts obligation planning** | Contract clause turned into last-time-buy alerts |
